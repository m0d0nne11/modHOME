# When we want to create a localized version of a file that's part
# of the official modHOME distribution, we could edit it in place
# under ~/modHOME but that goes against the "try to keep modHOME
# read-only" approach so the preferred method is to create a copy
# in the modHOME.custom hierarchy and leave the original untouched.
#
# This works because versions from modHOME.custom are (when they
# exist) used instead of the originals under modHOME - see the Bmod
# initialization script.
#
# This function creates that custom copy when it's mentioned as ARG1
#
