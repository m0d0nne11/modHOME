# Given a subdirectory named by the user on the command
# line and given an "active" TFTP boot-kernel symlink named
# "active" and one or more other (idle) such symlinks with
# names of the form "20011228010242" in that directory,
# this script will take the one that's currently active
# and rename it such that its name is of the idle form.
# Then the idle link that sorts lexicographically first
# will be established as the new active link.
#
# Since the numeric portion of each name is derived
# from the current date and time (and "active" always
# sorts last in such a list) the effect is that we
# rotate through the links.
