We, the multitudes here gathered, beseech you:

 Instead of force-feeding your learned dissertations to us
 here, why not instead maybe just broadcast one-line summaries
 and then invite interested parties to rendezvous elsewhere
 for further discussion, maybe via some blog, or email list,
 or newsgroup, or telephone conference call, etc, etc, etc...?

 Can you doubt that the resulting stampede of eager subscribers
 hurrying to that rendezvous point would reflect anything but
 the highest regard for your uniquely valuable perspectives?

 By sharing your penetrating insights on that other channel
 you'd make it possible for those of us who actually *DESERVE*
 to bathe in the compelling logic of your Only-Correct-
 Interpretation-Of-Reality to do so without being distracted
 by any of the Linux-related noise so often found here.

 Be assured that any of us who fail to take advantage of
 your offerings on that other channel are probably just sadly
 inferior individuals, congentially incapable of comprehending
 your brilliance and therefore unworthy of your attentions as
 we try to live out our bleak little lives.

 And if you find yourself offended or threatened by the
 prospect of NOT inflicting your unsolicited wisdom on us
 here, you might want to reexamine your motives and come to
 a deeper understanding of why you feel the need to engage in
 such behavior in front of a (semi-)captive audience...

So, consider yourselves beseeched, as in: please, Please, PLEASE!

This is all so totally fascinating that I urge you to create
another mailing list (similar to gnhlug-jobs or gnhlug-announce)
on which this discussion can be given the attention it deserves.
After you've created that list and invited all interested
parties to join it, I'm sure the resultant stampede rush of
folks hurrying to subscribe will be a %100 accurate indication
of the high regard we all have for this sort of thing...
