Hello,

You should be able to reach me at 978-710-9876.  I'm on the
move, though, so if you miss me I hope you'll feel free to 
leave a detailed message as that voicemail system is secure.

My resume is available online:

   http://b0rken.com/resumeMichaelODonnell.html

...and a plain text version is attached below, as well.

Regards,

  --Michael O'Donnell            (Chelmsford, MA)
