Subject: No overly complex email encodings, please

Howdy,

Please allow me to beg you to please, PLEASE not transmit
your email messages using anything other than plain old ASCII
text, OK?  Please do NOT use any of the pointlessly tricky
formats like HTML, RichText, TNEF, quoted-printable, etc, etc.
Remember, even if you happen to use something like a WWW
browser to read your email that doesn't mean that everybody
else does.  Plain old ASCII text is the only thing that's
guaranteed to be readable by all email softwares.  Thanks...


Regards,
