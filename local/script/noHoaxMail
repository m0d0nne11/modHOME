Please do not propagate unverified email warnings about scams,
viruses and such.  To date, it has turned out that the warning
messages themselves are the harm, rather than the problems they
purport to describe.  Unless you have personally been victimized
by the scam or virus in question, you should assume (based on
the history of several dozens of such false warnings now) that
the warning messages are *themselves* the mechanism intended to
victimize us all, by wasting our time, diskspace and bandwidth.
