# This file is part of the custom modHOME environment that I
# (MOD=Michael O'Donnell) sometimes inflict on systems where
# I'll be working for a while.  This Xmod script is sourced by
# anybody who wants to remove that custom environment and (largely)
# restore files to their state from just prior to its installation.
#
# Usage:  ./Xmod
#
# I try not to leave precious files anywhere in the modHOME
# hierarchy so it should always be OK to delete it without notice
# to reclaim disk space or just generally tidy things up, though
# it'd be good manners to talk to me first, if possible... ;->
